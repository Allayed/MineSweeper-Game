# MineSweeper-Game


-- Designed and developed the classic old Mine-Sweeper Game in Java.

-- Applied concepts of Objected Oriented Programming, where the game board was represented using two-dimensional arrays and the inner class listeners were defined to handle click events.

-- Used core Java and Swing GUI components for frontend to give users a similar experience of playing a real game
Implemented depth-first search algorithm at backend for searching mines when any field of game board is clicked.
